# 2-Back Task
Welcome to the Task repository. This holds the Python code for the 2-Back version of the N-Back.

- To run the task, simply download the repository and double click the main 2-Back.py file. All dependencies will be automatically installed.
- All data are stored in an sqlite3 .db database with .csv backups in the event of corruption or damage to the .db. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Tasks still to do in future updates (these will be updated as they are finalised):
- [ ] The SDT calculations need to be automated from the .db
- [ ] Check integration with EEG (has previously worked cleanly)
